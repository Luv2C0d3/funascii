The purpose of this file is to better understand how
macros are expanded.
The first variable in_s holds the results of
reading the input and transforming to s-exps,
every parentheses like [ and { are converted to regular (
without still expanding macros.

For now, copy this file to the folder where the language
in question is being developed.
